            Fertilisers are additional substances supplied to the crops to increase their productivity. These are used
            by the farmers daily to increase the crop yield. These fertilisers contain essential nutrients required by
            the plants, including nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.
        </p>
        <p>These three numbers represent the primary nutrients (nitrogen(N) - phosphorus(P) - potassium(K)). This label,
            known as the fertilizer grade, is a national standard. A bag of 10-10-10 fertilizer contains 10 percent
            nitrogen, 10 percent phosphate and 10 percent potash.</p>
        <p>
            Fertilizers are chemical chemicals that are added to the soil which promotes the growth of the plant and
            increases output. Farmers use these every day to increase crop output. The fertilizers contain nitrogen,
            potassium, and phosphorus, all of which are essential nutrients for plants. They increase the soilâ€™s
            fertility while improving its water retention capacity. India utilized more than 61 million tonnes of
            fertilizer in FY20, with urea accounting for 55% of that amount. Example-Urea, ammonia, potassium, etc.

            2. Organic Fertilizers

            Inorganic Fertilizers
            Inorganic fertilizers are chemical fertilizers that contain nutritional ingredients for crop growth and are
            produced by chemical processes. Inorganic fertilizers include:

            Nitrogen Fertilizers
            Nitrogen fertilizers are made up of nitrogen, which is necessary for agricultural growth. Nitrogen is an
            important component of chlorophyll that helps to keep the photosynthesis process balanced. It is also
            present as an amino acid component of protein in plants. They boost agricultural productivity and quality
            which helps plants to grow fast and healthy.

            Phosphorus Fertilizer
            Phosphorous is one of the essential elements for plants to grow. Effective phosphorus concentration,
            fertilization methods, soil conditions, and crop strains all influence fertilizer efficiency. Phosphorus
            present in the soil takes through the roots of plants and enters the cell cytoplasm and takes part in
            important reactions for growth and cell proliferation. The application of phosphorus fertilizer promotes the
            growth of plant roots.
